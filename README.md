 2 files added, both are word finders that find an occurence of a word of a certain length in a text file. wordfinder_simple has hard-coded values and is included to show the code necessary to accomplish the task of locating a word of specified length. WordFinder prompts the user for a complete file path and for length of word and number of occurence. WordFinder is not yet complete and will throw errors if improper data is entered. It is a workable internal tool but would need modification such as option to keep same file or enter a new file before it was used by internal teams. Some error handling would also be added.
